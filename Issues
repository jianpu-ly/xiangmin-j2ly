1. Sometimes, there are mismatching closing parentheses before `\breathe`,
   especially in staff notation, causing a warning message. Need to find
   an easy way to reproduce it and then resolve it.
2. For the automatically generated staff notation, merge the tied notes.
3. (Done) Need to figure out how to put time signature (4/4) after the key signature.
4. (No need) Figure out how to typeset \breathe as 'V' on top.
