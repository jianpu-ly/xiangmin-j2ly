1. Sometimes, there are mismatching closing parentheses before `\breathe`,
   especially in staff notation, causing a warning message. Need to find
   an easy way to reproduce it and then resolve it.
2. Need to figure out how to put time signature (4/4) after the key signature.
3. Figure out how to typeset \breathe as 'V' on top.
4. For the automatically generated staff notation, merge the tied notes.
