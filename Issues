1. Sometimes, there are mismatching closing parentheses before `\breathe`,
   especially in staff notation, causing a warning message. Need to find
   an easy way to reproduce it and then resolve it.
2. For the automatically generated staff notation, merge the tied notes.
3. (Done) Need to figure out how to put time signature (4/4) after the key signature.
4. (No need) Figure out how to typeset \breathe as 'V' on top.

Changes to upstream that haven't yet been brought into this version
(they might not all be needed though...)
* bug fix for short rests inside beamed groups splitting the beams https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-ly/commit/652b8c166fe7161befec6f5e869dbeac119a0d19
* ties should always start from numbers, never from dashes https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-ly/commit/5bfe561b42783e57e5defe530b876d3b7a813fc3
  (does `convert_ties_to_slurs` do the same thing?)
* RaggedLast & NoIndent options
* --version option (should be easy with argparse!)
* guitar chords option https://github.com/ssb22/jianpu-ly/commit/1125b35e065f2f98de31217b44162da068ccfe59
* j2ly_lyric_size different from j2ly_staff_size
